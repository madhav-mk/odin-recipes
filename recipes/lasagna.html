    <h3><em>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</em></h3>
    <p>Lasagna is both a type of pasta (wide, flat sheets) and a baked dish. The dish consists of layers of these pasta sheets, often alternating with fillings like ragù (meat sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings. It's typically baked in an oven and cut into portions.</p>
